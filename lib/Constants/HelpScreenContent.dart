      "In today's world, sustainability and novelty are crucial aspects to consider when evaluating a project. With this in mind, we have developed a model that evaluates computer science projects not only for their Novelty but with their alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are creating an easy-to-use app that employs machine learning and natural language processing to analyze project summaries. The app examines each project's description to determine which SDGs it supports and how novel the project is compared to other projects in the same domain.\n\n"
      "                The app provides users, level of novelty of their projects, encouraging users to come up with new and inventive ideas. Additionally, it also displays the associated SDGs for users' projects and gives a reason of how their project contributes to these global goals. By making the connection between projects, SDGs, and novelty clear, our model aims to inspire people to create sustainable, innovative, and novel projects in the computer science domain.";

      " 'Novelty' refers to the degree of originality or uniqueness of the project's idea, approach, or solution. A project with high novelty introduces something new, innovative, or creative that hasn't been done before, while a project with low novelty may involve well-established or commonly used methods and ideas.";
